This type of blockchain network separation occurs when an update to a blockchain protocol, but not all network participants' nodes agree to use it. Blockchains can find two main types of forks: a soft fork or a fork. Soft forks result in a 'back-to-back' update. This means that the nodes receiving the update can still communicate with the nodes that do not. On a solid fork, the update significantly changes the original blockchain protocol so that these two versions are no longer compatible. The effect of a strong fork is two different blockchains that differ after a solid fork event."
