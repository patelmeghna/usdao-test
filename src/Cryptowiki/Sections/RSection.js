            description="Return on Assets (ROA) is an indicator used to determine how much a company makes a profit compared to its total assets. This metric allows companies and other organizations to determine how their assets are acquired in order to make a profit. ROA is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the total profit of the business by its total assets. When the ROA is high, it raises the level of assets of an appropriate organization. ROA is often used to compare similar companies or to measure a company’s current performance against its previous performance. The ROA index also considers a company's debt rating in contrast to other common metrics such as Return on Equity (ROE)."

ROE is calculated to determine how much profit is generated per dollar of investment and helps institutional investors to evaluate how well their company is performing."

For example, if you invest $ 100 grown to $ 140, then the ROI will be represented as a residual interest ($ 140 - $ 100 = $ 40) divided by the investment cost ($ 100) that produces a ROI of $ 40 / $ 100, or 40%."

To help guide the process of developing a smart contract, Ride uses three main script types to create different types of smart contracts including dApp documents, account documents, and asset scripts. With Ride, accounts with assigned text become dApp or smart accounts while text assets become smart assets. This process is different from the development process commonly used in traditional programming languages ​​such as JavaScript, C, C ++, and others."
